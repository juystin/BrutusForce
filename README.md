# BRUTUS-FORCE

A web-scraping program written in Python using the Selenium library. This program scrapes The Ohio State University's room matrix system for a detailed list of all classes occurring on the Main Campus. This data is outputted as a .db file.

The data collected from this program could be used for a variety of tasks -- including finding the nearest currently empty classroom, finding classrooms that are empty at a certain time, etc. all very simply (and leaps and bounds more efficiently than going through the actual website).

ClassroomQuery is a testing program built to read Brutus-Force's classes.db and perform queries on open classrooms.
